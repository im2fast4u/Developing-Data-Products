##Objective
This application uses the Cars93 data from the MASS library to analyze the relationship between car weight and miles per gallon in city and on highway. It uses a third variable, horsepower, to select a range of horsepower to represent on the charts

##Charts
There are two charts
(1) Car Weight versus Miles per Gallon in City
(2) Car Weight versus Miles per Gallon on Highway

These charts show the the 93 car models from the MASS dataset. Inside the chart the car models are differentiated by type (example, compact, sports etc.)
