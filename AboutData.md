##Data from 93 Cars on Sale in the USA in 1993

The data can be downloaded in R using the MASS library

Cars were selected at random from among 1993 passenger car models that were listed in both the Consumer Reports issue and the PACE Buying Guide. Pickup trucks and Sport/Utility vehicles were eliminated due to incomplete information in the Consumer Reports source. Duplicate models (e.g., Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance) were listed at most once.

Further description can be found in Lock (1993).
